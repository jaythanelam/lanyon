So we woke up Saturday morning to hundreds of marathon runners cutting through the neighborhood from the lake taking part in the annual [St patricks day festivies](http://www.stpatsmadison.org/ "St patricks day festivies")!

Celebration is big up here in the old country :). Jennifer, Noah, Jay, and I put together our greatest efforts to support and cheer for the Irish. The parade was a fun filled rush of bands, kilts, candy, and loads of green!

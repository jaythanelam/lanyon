Our first trip to DC was punctuated by 3 main events:

1st &#8211; Jennifer flies. &nbsp;That&#8217;s right my now well traveled hubby had never been on a plane before our trip up from TN and it was one for the books! As he secured our stuff and then reviewed the emergency pamphlet, he then promptly grabbed the armrest like a lifeline and didn&#8217;t let go until we bounced in for a landing.

2nd &#8211; We ride the metro. &nbsp;Again a first for my farm boy and as it&#8217;s rush hour in DC, we split up and sit apart. &nbsp;As I turn to let J know our stop is coming, I laugh out loud as a man has fallen asleep and is slouched over using J like a pillow &#8211; priceless.

Our last adventure was a trip to Georgetown where for all intent and purposes, was a fun but decidedly uneventful night. We toured the city, visited a psychic (who told me I would marry the man I was with:) and drank at this little bar overlooking the main strip. &nbsp;I bring it up as we had the opportunity, now 10 years later, to sit and reminisce. We drank, watched a little world cup and toasted ourselves to wealth, health, and happiness. &nbsp;At least we&#8217;ve got 2 out of 3 ðŸ™‚

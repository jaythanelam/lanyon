Â I keep all this in mind as I begin my fight.

Getting a night out together is such a crazy show. Â Everything has to click &#8220;just-so&#8221; to get out the door. Â Tonight, I feel confident in our execution and prep! Â we have the kids set, the babysitters&#8217; checked in, both Jennifer and I are dressed and pretty ðŸ™‚ Â Ima&#8217;s throwing a fit on the floor and Noah&#8217;s running around celebrating naked time. Â All seems to be pretty normal ðŸ™‚ I reach for the tickets, grab the envelope and watch dumbstruck as one ticket slides out, slowly falling &#8211; and by sheer karmic wind current &#8211; is sucked effortlessly between the tiny space outlining the matchup of our kitchen counter and the cement wall. Â I idolized that wall when we moved in. I thought &#8220;what a cool way to do this space.&#8221; I look at it now and wonder if we can hack into it. Â I have to get that ticket! Â I turn around betting on some sound assurance from Jennifer, Â instead I watch as he patiently takes off his jacket, lays it neatly on the back of the chair and picks Ima up in resignation. Â I want to cry.

There was a time awhile back when i painfully went through some soul searching. Â I had a friend point out that it always seems we have SOMETHING happening. Â Some freakish, out of the ordinary &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this!&#8221; thing. Â I emphatically denied said accusation as I had just always assumed everyones&#8217; life, while different, followed its&#8217; own crazy road. Â I still believe in that, but I&#8217;ve also come to realize that our choices, our happenstance, our fate and karma all come together and seem to totally freak out on road Jennifer. Â I don&#8217;t feel its&#8217; bad luck, quite the opposite as it always seems to right itself into something great. Â That being said, this thing, this happened in another life &#8211; situation making me stronger &#8211; have to look at it in a different way -sometimes sucks, sometimes karma&#8217;s a bitch ðŸ˜‰

So, the ticket. Â I call the wilco venue and explain our plight. Â I beg for assistance and hope for empathy. Â I do not receive it. We go anyway. Â We arrive at the Overture center and descend on the will-call window. Â I again explain the crazy, freakish, unbelievable luck that is now our ticket. Â We soon have an audience. Â I use this to my advantage and raise my voice for help. Â It works ðŸ˜‰

The concert rocked. Â Wilco was intoxicating. Â We came home different people having been able to break from mom and dad back into Jennifer and Jennifer. Â  Always makes the fight totally worth it!

This weekend was one of quiet reflection, lazy days, and easy going family memories-!! at least that&#8217;s what it would have been if we hadn&#8217;t had a million things on the to-do list and a tight 48 hour window to do them:) not to mention the fact that our little man wasn&#8217;t feeling well and for the first time had a fever up into the 104&#8217;s! After a couple of calls to the pediatrician and one harried trip to Urgent Care, we tried to relax the day away in our pj&#8217;s and enjoy what I can only assume will be one of the last beautifully warm, wonderfully windy, perfect weekends! before we start getting our snow boots on and gearing up for the ski season!

Hope you all had just as much fun!

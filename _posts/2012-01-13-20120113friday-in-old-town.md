[This was a perfect day&#8230; We took off with the kids and went to old town alexandria. Â The boutiques were awesomely expensive and the deli where we grabbed lunch was like the Nazi soup kitchen come to life in DC. Â I stepped up to the order line and started with my list: Jennifer &#8211; spicy chicken, kids &#8211; turkey and cheese no bread no condo&#8217;s, me &#8211; Â quiche. Â The chef &#8211; staring across the glass divide &#8211; DOES NOT MOVE Â and as the line starts to back up I&#8217;m not sure what to do!! the cashier walks back to let me know that I need to order using their menu specific number system. I quickly recount &#8211; 3,6, 11. Â I step sideways down the counter as our food is put together and scooted down the counter with me. I reach the end, pay, pick up my sack and squeeze out the door.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628856000031/)

[The food was AWESOME! Â Would strongly recommend the deli if I had the foresight to grab a menu on my way out LOL (i guess we&#8217;ll have to go back ðŸ™‚ The kids fed the ducks with the seagulls overhead going CRAZY! Â we capped the day checking out million dollar row houses&#8230; 5 flights of pure delight. Â  ahhhh the good life&#8230;](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628856000031/)

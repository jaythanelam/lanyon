Ever Gray was born 11/24/2012, exactly one week from her due date. &nbsp;She weighed in at 8lbs 6oz &#8211; the exact weight of her big brother &#8211; and measured 20.75 inches. &nbsp;She worried me at first as she was so incredibly mellow! &nbsp;Of course now, as I write this, we are nearing week 5 and undoubtedly, we have &nbsp;a very colicky baby on our hands.&nbsp;

We braced for a challenge and are juggling being parents of 4 but every now and then, I look over and there is a glimmer of the fun and fantastic adventures we are about to embark on. &nbsp;As a team. as a family of 6.</p>

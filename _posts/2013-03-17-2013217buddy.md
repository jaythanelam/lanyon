It&#8217;s taken me weeks to figure out Harley&#8217;s new &#8220;Harl-speak&#8221;. With each kiddo there has a language before the language. A way of pronouncing and identifying the world that is only known to them and if I&#8217;m lucky &#8211; to me as well. I am writjng as I have just unearthed the key to what Harley talks about most of the time: NOAH! She calls him BUDDY as I refer to him wih many different nicknames &#8211; buddy, bug, little man. Well she&#8217;s latched onto buddy and now, as she is telling me her long and drawn out story of what happened and where. I have decifered the most important side kick to her hero. Her Noah = buddy :):) it&#8217;s big folks. Mind blowingly big!<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; " />

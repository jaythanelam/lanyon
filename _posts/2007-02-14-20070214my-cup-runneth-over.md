This morning, I was reminded as to why i am the luckiest woman ever. I woke up to a stunning arrangement of tulips sitting next to an equally beautifully wrapped gift that i soon found out was a new [ipod shuffle](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=BE7AE809&nclm=iPodshuffle "ipod shuffle") whom i have lovingly named &#8220;sweething&#8221; as that was the inscription on my valentine!

My old ipod, Bungy, having gasped out his last breath with my trip to DC, was a devastating loss and my husband, picking up on the subtleties of my distress, surprised me with this newfound contraption! I have to tell you, I could not be more ecstatic with its small, wonderfully thought out, brilliantly made just for me abilities!

So for all of you love birds out there, HAPPY V-DAY! Hope you had just as an eventful day!

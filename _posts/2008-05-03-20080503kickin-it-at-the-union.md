I can imagine no better birth-control than seeing 10 toddlers trounce their way through campus. I&#8217;m not kidding, if I would have seen me 2 years ago with all those babies, i would have gone running! but today, today we conquer the fountain! (and feed the ducks, share some ice-cream, have some snack, take a couple bathroom breaks, play some baseball, and oh yeah&#8230;enjoy each-other!

[I was shocked at how much our city had changed!! I haven&#8217;t been back since our wedding (5+years) and I was so excited to explore and share our beginning with our kids. As soon as we got on campus, I was totally caught up in memory lane! We started at the chapel where Jennifer and I got married. I immediately go into detail about how we met at orientation and that click you get when you know you&#8217;ve met your person&#8230;.. I look over at them and have to laugh as I see complete disinterest mixed with a good healthy dose of excitement at just being out of the car LOL. Either way, there&#8217;s just something special about our little city. Maybe Tennessee is where we&#8217;ll end up after all!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630711956970/)

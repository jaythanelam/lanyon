Feeling overwhelmed today. As in &#8211; we have 4 kiddos, 1 of me, and everyone seems to need something different. So I turned on some music, cranked it up, and watched them laugh, dance and all-out let lose! That&#8217;s when it hit me. There&#8217;s one of me, but there&#8217;s 6 of us 🙂<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; " />

Ahhh friends, I&nbsp;had such high hopes for this weekend! and I&nbsp;don&#8217;t just mean the kites!!LOL!!!!&nbsp;I had visions of a&nbsp;picnic on&nbsp;the Washington Mall with Jennifer and I toasting our good fortune as our adorably well behaved children played with their kites around us, enjoying the sunshine&#8230;&nbsp;

The reality was&nbsp;bitingly cold winds that were more likely to turn our adorable and sparkly kites into dive bombing kamikaze machines, tears,&nbsp;falls and major frustration &#8211;&nbsp;Ima literally got wrapped up in her kite strings (see pic below)&nbsp;all leading to the painful realization that we needed to bail.&nbsp;Jennifer called it a win &#8211;&nbsp;we did indeed see some kites, we shared in that joy for about 2 seconds&nbsp;and then we bundled up to enjoy a picnic in the warm cuddliness of our living room&#8230; #4kidsandcounting&nbsp;&nbsp;#kitefestivalfail #rollinwiththegoodtimes&nbsp;

Ima started preschool with all of the gusto pomp and circumstance you can imagine. She changed her outfit at least 4 times before breakfast, debated her hairstyle for a full 30 minutes and decided on red bag with purple shoes as her last minute accessory. My little fashionista is going to change the world as we know it!! starting right here in pre-K :):)

We just finished ringing in Noah&#8217;s 3rd birthday. We threw him a party; celebrating his life, his birth, his nature and character and I cried! I cried as my sister surprised me, alighting from the car with my parents. I cried when Noah saw his cake &#8211; the exact color (chocolate), flavor (chocolate:) and pic (brontosaurus) that he dreamed up &#8211; and his entire face lit up. I cried when I kissed him goodnight as he ambled off with nana and popie for a sleepover. I teared up as my nephew (all 17 lbs:) body slammed my hubbie as he was winding down for the night. and I definetly bawled like a baby to say my goodbyes. It was such a joyous weekend.  <img title="photo" height="713" alt="photo" width="950" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-445" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50db6bb3e4b015296cd43789/50dfa5b1e4b0dc6320e0b5ea/50dfa5b2e4b0dc6320e0b72f/1254577936000/?format=original" />

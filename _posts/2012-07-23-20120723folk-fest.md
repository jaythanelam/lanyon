I was expecting folk-y, hippyish, dancing/music. It was more a HUGE and impressively made quilt devoted to AIDS along with a series of activities sponsored by different universities, highlighting environmental and sustainable living. Was I impressed, you betcha! I have 3 kiddos that love The Show and my quick detail of the festival was quickly forgotten once we rode the metro, walked along the grass downtown, and were enticed every 30 feet by a new food vendor. Ahhhhh to be a kid again.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630714951490/)

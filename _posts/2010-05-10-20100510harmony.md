  Every night after baths we have each kiddo pick out a story to read.  These books vary from a quick picture book to &#8220;the hobbit&#8221; novel.  Tonight Ima&#8217;s pick was Puff the Magic Dragon.  As Jennifer and i belt out the lyrics, synching our dubious 2 part harmony, Noah starts to sing with us!!  It was such a moment.   When I looked over and saw him trilling this epitomy of a childhood song, I wanted to cry.  I feel that everyday, if we have a moment where we synch, where we connect as a family, as our own little island, I am truly blessed!  Tonight&#8217;s&#8217; moment, as Jennifer&#8217;s howling &#8220;OHHHH puff the magic dragon&#8221; to the heavens and Noah is dancing to the music between us, Ima looks on in fascination with her 2 little fingers stuck in her mouth, I can&#8217;t ask for better.

Night. Night.

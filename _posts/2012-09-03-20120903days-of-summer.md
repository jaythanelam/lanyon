These last days of summer are so precious. Even more so as I know our lives, the simplicity and effortless happiness of our fit &#8211; is all about to change. Noah and Ima are about to start school and our new little one will be here before I can blink. This sliver of time, where I have them all to myself, where our schedule is our own to bend and shape each day. Our spontaneity and freedom to come and go is changing and for that, I revel this moment &#8211; each trip, every smile, each connection, I am so happy with this path 🙂

I put it to a vote &#8211; be lazy on our first day off or go out &#8211; out won and we headed to the zoo :):) The national zoo _is_ pretty incredible and every time we make the trip, I feel like we discover a new piece, plus, it&#8217;s F. R. E. E. FREE! &nbsp;But a little known fact about this national treasure, it is entirely UPHILL! Sooooo what&#8217;s a mama to do with 4 (yep these are all mine:) kiddos in tow on a mile high trek &#8211; SPEED! We push uphill as quick as possible &#8211; flying by the big cats, walking under the chimps crossing, waving to the Ghenghis Khan horses &#8211; all the way to the tippy top, Savanna, where we promptly throw out a picnic and break for lunch. &nbsp;We then meander, as now we have the world at our feet, and slowly make our way back down the path. &nbsp;It works!

This trip we veered off down the Asian Trail which dumped us on the backend of the park. Just as I try to figure out how we went wrong, we happen upon Amazonia! I give the kids a, &#8220;I totally planned this. Mommy is awesome&#8221; smile as we venture in and guess what, It is awesome! A rainforest exhibit with HUGE! barracuda, poisonous frogs, cocoa trees, and little baby resident monkeys that wrapped with an entire wing devoted to research on the Amazon River Basin HELLO SCIENCE!!! Great kick-off to the summer!&nbsp;

Getting a night out together is such a crazy show.  Everything has to click &#8220;just-so&#8221; to get out the door.  Tonight, I feel confident in our execution and prep!  we have the kids set, the babysitters&#8217; checked in, both Jennifer and I are dressed and pretty 🙂  Ima&#8217;s throwing a fit on the floor and Noah&#8217;s running around celebrating naked time.  All seems to be pretty normal 🙂 I reach for the tickets, grab the envelope and watch dumbstruck as one ticket slides out, slowly falling &#8211; and by sheer karmic wind current &#8211; is sucked effortlessly between the tiny space outlining the matchup of our kitchen counter and the cement wall.  I idolized that wall when we moved in. I thought &#8220;what a cool way to do this space.&#8221; I look at it now and wonder if we can hack into it.  I have to get that ticket!  I turn around betting on some sound assurance from Jennifer,  instead I watch as he patiently takes off his jacket, lays it neatly on the back of the chair and picks Ima up in resignation.  I want to cry.

There was a time awhile back when i painfully went through some soul searching.  I had a friend point out that it always seems we have SOMETHING happening.  Some freakish, out of the ordinary &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this!&#8221; thing.  I emphatically denied said accusation as I had just always assumed everyones&#8217; life, while different, followed its&#8217; own crazy road.  I still believe in that, but I&#8217;ve also come to realize that our choices, our happenstance, our fate and karma all come together and seem to totally freak out on road Jennifer.  I don&#8217;t feel its&#8217; bad luck, quite the opposite as it always seems to right itself into something great.  That being said, this thing, this happened in another life &#8211; situation making me stronger &#8211; have to look at it in a different way -sometimes sucks, sometimes karma&#8217;s a bitch 😉

So, the ticket.  I call the wilco venue and explain our plight.  I beg for assistance and hope for empathy.  I do not receive it. We go anyway.  We arrive at the Overture center and descend on the will-call window.  I again explain the crazy, freakish, unbelievable luck that is now our ticket.  We soon have an audience.  I use this to my advantage and raise my voice for help.  It works 😉

The concert rocked.  Wilco was intoxicating.  We came home different people having been able to break from mom and dad back into Jennifer and Jennifer.   Always makes the fight totally worth it!

We&#8217;ve been to a barrage of birthday parties in the past couple of months, including my own, ringing in the big #2 with all of our special friends (although I am slightly above that&#8230; ringing in the big 2-8!!) I was lucky enough to wake up and open presents with my adoring husband and then travel to Friendship, WI where I was pleasantly surprised by my girls as they plied me with cake and gifts:)Noah is the baby of the group and so his b-day this Sunday will close our birthday season&#8230; This is just one of our more cherished memories. I actually lost the invite to this party and so, being the level headed and completely sane pregnant woman I am, I made Jennifer drive around Madison until we found it. He did! How can I not love that man!

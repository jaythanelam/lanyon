[There are times in life when something happens that is so catastrophic, it is forever etched into your brain. As a child, you touch a hot burner, burn your hand, you don&#8217;t do it again. It&#8217;s perfectly logical that these same survival tactics exist as a parent, but it&#8217;s still just as shocking when something hits. I will preface that being a parent &#8211; whether you have 1 or 10 children &#8211; has trying moments, moments when you lose sight, lose focus, just lose. As a mother of 3 children &#8211; with another otw &#8211; there are moments when I am not, let&#8217;s say, 100% on top of each child&#8217;s motivations :):) These are the moments I share with you today. When Ima was 2, she unlocked the front door and walked out past our house into the middle of the street where a man driving by saw her. I heard a commotion, not even considering it had anything to do with me, and went out to see if I could help&#8230; I completely lost it when I envisioned what could have happened. Lesson learned, Ima can work the deadbolt &#8211; sliding locks went in on all the doors. There was once a time when my brother was playing with Noah after dinner, swinging him around in circles, I&#8217;ve never seen anyone get that sick that after eating, now our Team Elam rule is 30 minutes of rest after we eat to give our food time to digest :):) My dad once told me of a time when he and my uncle were playing with a candle under their bed when the bed caught fire. As they lived to tell the tale and gained forgiveness for setting the house on fire, I feel it is a testament of our ability to survive childhood that makes us into the well rounded adults we are today. I am sharing these harrowing life lessons with you as last week I had another, heart stopping moment, that will forever be branded in my &#8220;mom life lessons&#8221; collection. It started off as an innocent enough outing with my mom and the kiddos as we set off to explore this jazz painting event downtown. This supposedly family-friendly event w/ games, music, easels and paints &#8211; sounded great! Unfortunately, the event was very sedate and high brow &#8211; mostly business professionals and their wine. The kids saw the atrium, heard the echoes of their little voices and we stood out like a sore thumb. Anyways, to make the best out of the trip we decided to look around the adjoining museum. We come across a very cool, hands-on! computer exhibit where the history of gaming &#8211; from pack-man to call of duty invite you to play. We come across a hall of statues &#8211; horses, people &#8211; all made out of driftwood. We then come into a section where an entire wall of the museum is covered by a bank of tvs, all playing something different, highlighted in the shape of the United States. Virginia alone has 3 different stations playing cartoons, news and games. It was cool 🙂 We are transfixed. At least I am, my mom is, my oldest and youngest but my middle child, my Ima, is unimpressed and instead sees a painting 10 times her size that looks like an enormous xylophone. She runs over and bangs on it&#8230; And not just a tap, but all out bongo drumming where the booming reverberates through the entire hall. As I turn towards the banging, I see 2 things: first, a security guard streaking across the room, and second, my daughter laying into this painting, palm open, smile out. Fortunately, Nana &#8211; who still walks with a slight limp from her knee replacement surgery, who&#8217;s walked miles all through the afternoon &#8211; is between the security guard and Ima before I can even take a step. I rush over and am instantly contrite. This is my child, I take responsibility for her actions. I am very sorry she touched what is obviously a no-touch zone of the museum. My mom, on the other hand, the colonel in the Army, is assertive! almost combative as she interrupts me and starts arguing the museum&#8217;s guidelines on touching, the lay out of the displays &#8211; how were we to know this was not interactive like the adjoining section we just left&#8230; The security guard demands we remain on the premises until the painting can be reviewed and looked over for damage by the curator. Nana continues. The exhibit previous to this was entirely hands on. There is no visible damage to the painting. She will stay as long as she likes anyways because it is a public museum and she has every right to continue looking around. I stand there with my mouth open. I look at the painting and try to reason out a worst case scenario: we bring this painting home. It is a very simple line rendition that upon greater reflection, as it is in the American Art Museum, no matter how simple it looks, we cannot afford. I think about getting sick or feigning some pregnancy malady. I look down and see that Ima is confused. She is not quite sure what is wrong yet. I tell her that we&#8217;re in trouble. And reiterate the importance of looking with your eyes and not your hands. She says, &#8220;yes mam.&#8221; To make a long story short, we get off. Another security guard, the same who checked our bags coming in and heard our &#8220;do not touch&#8221; lecture from the get go, examines the painting and rules there is no damage. We are free to go. I want to throw up now for real. Do I regret going, No way! I love exploring as a family and while we might need extra reinforcements to corral our team &#8211; as well as a paper bag for mommy &#8211; I&#8217;ll never stop getting out there and showing them the world. I want them to know the jubilation of getting lost just to see where they&#8217;ll end up. Or to witness something truly inspiring even though it&#8217;s not dubbed &#8220;kid friendly&#8221; but life lesson: maybe our next visit I go against my value system and get some of those kid-leashes JIC :):)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157631168601128/)

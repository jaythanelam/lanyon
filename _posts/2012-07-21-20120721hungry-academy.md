[As I walked through the doors of the elusive (couldn&#8217;t find it on my google maps) and hallowed halls of the hungry academy office, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect. I was prepared to be inspired and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed! The entire office was outfitted with technology galore peppered with game tables and small comfy coves to chat. Littered with DC students all learning and discussing the new and upcoming, it was wonderful! This was the first of a series of discussions on new technology and the improvements/upgrades online. Good times :):)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630711096706/)

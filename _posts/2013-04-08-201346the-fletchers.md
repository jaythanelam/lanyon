We just got home from a rousing birthday party at some friends of ours &#8211; Lily and Ima met at preschool and took to eachother like wildfire, Cole, their son totally clicks with Noah and their mama, the elephant tamer herself! I am quickly coming to adore &#8211; that is going down in the history books as one of our all time family fun days! Even Ever smiled all the way home! So Fletcher&#8217;s welcome to the family ðŸ™‚

[There is a sliver of quiet here that we stumbled across and I have absolutely and irrevocably fallen in love.  It&#8217;s just outside of the city and on this day we: discovered an oasis, watched water shoot into the sky, built a house, tracked an eagle, had a picnic, and experienced life from a teeny tiny perspective. I can only wrap it up to say, &#8220;I want to go to there!&#8221; ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628350540187/)

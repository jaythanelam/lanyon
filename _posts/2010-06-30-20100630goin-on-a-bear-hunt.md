[<img title="bearhunt" height="442" alt="" width="590" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-759" src="/teamelam/assets/images/Goinand-8217-on-a-berry-huntand-8230/1278566375000-missing.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157624266820683/)Our plan was strawberries.  Big, juicy, organic, local strawberries.  Our reality &#8211; strawberry season ended last week!  So we walked around and identified different plants that produced some of their other produce &#8211; raspberries, snap peas, green beans, green onion and yes some outlying strawberry stragglers.  All in all it was a pretty fantastic day until I hear a little voice next to me &#8220;Mommy, I have to go potty!&#8221;  Now that&#8217;s a whole other story&#8230;

thanks fr the title Leah you rock!

Our traditional 1 year birthday party starts with a Mexican restaurant and ends with a dynamite margarita &#8211; we also celebrate our kiddo in there usually christening them with a HUGE sombrero ðŸ™‚

I am absolutely delighted with our Ever Gray. &nbsp;She has such a happy and mellowed temperament &#8211; just fun to be around. &nbsp;As most of you know, she is our miracle baby, a surprise to both J and I, but one we have never doubted. &nbsp;Looking back, it&#8217;s a wonder how we were ever without Ever LOL. &nbsp;Ever, you complete this family. You make our hearts a little lighter and give each of us a piece of your happiness everyday. We love you so very much!

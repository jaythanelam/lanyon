We just finished ringing in Noah&#8217;s 3rd birthday. We threw him a party; celebrating his life, his birth, his nature and character and I cried! I cried as my sister surprised me, alighting from the car with my parents. I cried when Noah saw his cake &#8211; the exact color (chocolate), flavor (chocolate:) and pic (brontosaurus) that he dreamed up &#8211; and his entire face lit up. I cried when I kissed him goodnight as he ambled off with nana and popie for a sleepover. I teared up as my nephew (all 17 lbs:) body slammed my hubbie as he was winding down for the night. and I definetly bawled like a baby to say my goodbyes. It was such a joyous weekend.  <img title="photo" height="713" alt="photo" width="950" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-445" src="/teamelam/assets/images/milestone/1254577936000-missing.jpg" />

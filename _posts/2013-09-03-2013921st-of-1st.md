Tonight we finished Noah&#8217;s summer reading list with, &#8220;At the Zoo&#8221; &#8211; a likely choice after our end of summer days. &nbsp;I literally chocked up listening to him read. My little boy. My brilliant little man reading to me about spots and the circus &#8211; all on his own! He starts first grade tomorrow. I am just so stinking proud of him!

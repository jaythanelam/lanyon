[For those of you who know me, you know I can&#8217;t get enough family time!  so when we planned our christmas vacation to Oahu,  I was in heaven!  Our nautical minded son couldn&#8217;t think about anything else, our attention starved 2 year old was bouncing to get 2 whole weeks of extra nana poppi lovin and the love of my life was holding on tight to the possibility of a late late date night.  It defied even our wildest expectations](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157625807582537/)!

<a rel="attachment wp-att-421" href="/teamelam/assets/images/still-here/1252717088000-missing.jpg" /></a>I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s still hard to get through today&#8230; That&#8217;s not true, it&#8217;s not fair to say its hard, it should be, it helps keep things in perspective. All of a sudden the mishaps and drama that made up my life, don&#8217;t really add up to much &#8211; because we&#8217;re all still here!  We&#8217;re still together.  We&#8217;re a team and it&#8217;s that, that makes the difference.

Mom, I love you. I know you&#8217;ve lost, I know you hurt, but you&#8217;re still here for so many reasons!  You&#8217;re here to save lives, to leave flowers, to say your prayers.  You&#8217;re here to remind and remember, to create, to prepare, to defend no matter what comes. You&#8217;re here to love and shelter, to play, and to laugh, to teach and to lead.

YOU ARE HERE! I am so thankful for that. for you.

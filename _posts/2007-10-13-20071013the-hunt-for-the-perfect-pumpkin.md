We did our annual stint to the [Treinen Farms](http://www.treinenfarm.com/ "Treinen Farms") pumpkin patch to pick our perfects this year! The weather was just right as we trolled the patch with hundreds of our closest midwestern friends! We had a picnic lunch, rode the horse drawn carriage, saw more animals than we could count and played in the largest vat of corn I&#8217;ve ever seen! It was quite a day!

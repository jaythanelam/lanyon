he has spoken!! Noah said his first word today! dada has been uttered and mumbled 10 times since and if you listen long enough to the babble, you’ll at least hear dada along with a myriad of other small syllables such as ahhhh, maaaaa, baaaaa, you get the point! I hope everyone is having a fantastic weekend!
  
HAPPY EASTER!

Harley is absolutely delightful :):) Everyday she shares a new word or discovers a new way and it is constant fun to watch her. She has learned the phrase &#8220;help me!&#8221; She sits at the top of the stairs and her little voice cries out &#8220;HELP ME!&#8221; for a ride down. She works it in pointing to give the dog a treat or for a sweat-tart out of the bigs halloween baskets. It is endearing and combined with her overall cheerful disposition, is impossible to resist and almost always wins her a leg up!

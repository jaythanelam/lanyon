<img title="MCO_build" height="422" alt="MCO_build" width="950" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-556" src="/teamelam/assets/images/MCO-and-8211-itand-8217-s-official/1259673769000-missing.jpg" />I played my first concert with the MADISON ORCHESTRA this past weekend.  It was a nerve-racking, exhilarating, and ultimately humblingly proud experience as, for the first time, I looked out into the crowd and saw my son, completely awestruck and seemingly mesmerized with the stage! It was such an amazing moment for me as I could see everything register to him; the music (fyi &#8211; Mendelssohn: Hebrides, Glazunov: “From the Middle Ages” Symphonic Suite, and Stravinsky: Berceuse and Finale from Firebird 1919) my cello, Blake our conductor,  all swam across his face!!  I also saw my husband, looking back at me with such pride and strength &#8211; it was staggering the love I felt from him.

Jennifer, you are my partner in crime, my best friend, my lobster. I would never be the person I am without you.  You who picked up the slack so I could practice, who nudged me on when I was too tired to go, who shouted from the rafters that I made the MCO, and who never missed a beat.  You are my quan!

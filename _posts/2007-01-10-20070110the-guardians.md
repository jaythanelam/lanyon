I&#8217;ve been trying to write this post since christmas. it&#8217;s one of those topics that I just didn&#8217;t know how to approach. I thought about coming at it with a joke, &#8220;Yes, these two crazy kooks are Noah&#8217;s choice for life after mom and dad.&#8221; or did I want to be serious, &#8220;Jennifer and I feel that jason and Emily embody all that is important and right and want that instilled in our child&#8221; or considered it from Noah&#8217;s perspective, &#8220;I have decided that my uncle jason and my auntie em just get me and so I want them to be my god parents!&#8221; (But i thought that sounded a little too, &#8220;Look Who&#8217;s Talking&#8221;)when it came down to it i realized exactly what i needed to say&#8230; thanks you guys we love you both and couldn&#8217;t be happier!

But seriously, nature dominates up here.  The seasons are not just by-words but are a true force, halting all matter of activity. and yet, there is something so quiet and peaceful about our world covered in white.  It&#8217;s a new world, a fresh start, and until it gets all yucky from exhaust and melt, it&#8217;s just beautiful&#8230;

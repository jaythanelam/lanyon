What a bang-a-rang weekend! We had soccer games with both bigs. Ima totally knocked my socks off with her drive and quickness &#8211; this is her Ima endzone dance after a goal ðŸ™‚   
Noah&#8217;s game was equally exciting as he&#8217;s just graduated to a whole new level of play where the fields are bigger, the goals are wider, and the game as a whole is just fun to get caught up in!! Happy Weekend!

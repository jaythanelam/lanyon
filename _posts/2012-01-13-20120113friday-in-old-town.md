[This was a perfect day&#8230; We took off with the kids and went to old town alexandria.  The boutiques were awesomely expensive and the deli where we grabbed lunch was like the Nazi soup kitchen come to life in DC.  I stepped up to the order line and started with my list: Jennifer &#8211; spicy chicken, kids &#8211; turkey and cheese no bread no condo&#8217;s, me &#8211;  quiche.  The chef &#8211; staring across the glass divide &#8211; DOES NOT MOVE  and as the line starts to back up I&#8217;m not sure what to do!! the cashier walks back to let me know that I need to order using their menu specific number system. I quickly recount &#8211; 3,6, 11.  I step sideways down the counter as our food is put together and scooted down the counter with me. I reach the end, pay, pick up my sack and squeeze out the door.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628856000031/)

[The food was AWESOME!  Would strongly recommend the deli if I had the foresight to grab a menu on my way out LOL (i guess we&#8217;ll have to go back 🙂 The kids fed the ducks with the seagulls overhead going CRAZY!  we capped the day checking out million dollar row houses&#8230; 5 flights of pure delight.   ahhhh the good life&#8230;](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628856000031/)

[As far back as I can remember, we &#8211; the davenport family &#8211; wake up in the wee hours of easter sunday to attend sunrise service. I have seen the sunrise with shamu at seaworld, at the beach in corpus christi &#8211; and while Jennifer is less than excited that this, out of all of our traditions, is a special event I want to continue &#8211; we woke and headed downtown for a beautiful, and maybe a little chilly ðŸ™‚ sunrise. What an inspiring easter!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630711427194/)

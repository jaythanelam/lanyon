&#8220;Tradition&#8221; is a funny word. Loosely defined as an act repeated and brought from the past into the present. Our tradition, the first we did upon moving to wisconsin and the reoccurring event we have then experianced every year since: pumpkins. We drive to [treinen farm](http://www.treinenfarm.com/) where we visit the dogs, goats, lamas, chickens, and horses and on a good day, take the horse drawn carriage to the pumpkin patch where we peruse and carefully select THE squash of choice.

But this day, the day we chose to venture out to this picturesque farm and begin our adoration that is halloween; WAS FREEZING! It began snowing as we left the city and was so wicked cold we couldn&#8217;t even get the gumption to get on the carriage!!  So after much debate and not a lot of argument from our little people 🙂 we celebrated our trip with a Crockett picnic in which we enjoyed hotdogs, coke and each-other!

We love music. I play it after a long day. Blast it after a severe tantrum. Lull the kids to sleep with some new age. But what I absolutely LOVE is when something comes on that just takes you back &#8211;   
Jennifer and I got engaged on top of a mountain overlooking the Chattanooga valley. He asked me as we both sat on this huge boulder planning our future, sharing our dreams. And as we drove back down that hill, this song, aptly named &#8220;don&#8217;t panic&#8221; &#8211; came on and I&#8217;ll never forget it. We had the windows down, and the sun coming through the trees, and I had such hope and promise about our future. A future we&#8217;re now living.  
Love that :):):)

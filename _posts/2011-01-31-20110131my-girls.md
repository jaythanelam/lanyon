I never expected the contentment life has provided me, but what i really couldn&#8217;t see coming were you girls!!  _ **Cara, Leah, Jade, Beth, Molly, Christine, Jenny, Mattia, Eliza, and Laura**_&#8230; you guys are my quan.  We&#8217;ve been through thick and thin and are continuing to grow to change the world; through our kids, through our experiences, through our guts and determination!  I know no matter where we end up, it all started here, with us, with the support and understanding, with the appreciation of what each of us brings to life, we&#8217;re our own team.  I love you guys and couldn&#8217;t imagine life without you.

They say it takes a village to raise a family, they&#8217;re right! sometimes you have to make your village and I wouldn&#8217;t want to live anywhere else!

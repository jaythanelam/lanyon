[I got that minute today. As we rode out of the marina and the water opened up in front of us, the kids settled and we took off into the wind; all went quiet. No TVs, no phones, no talking, I watched Jennifer relax up front and Noah and Ima take their cue from him as they looked out at the birds and the trees&#8230; Dad found his channel and we just coasted&#8230;We made it out to Quantico where Jennifer and I tried out our captain&#8217;s skills &#8211; we&#8217;re trying to gear up for a fun mommy/daddy day ðŸ™‚ As we headed back into the noise and hustle of our lives I said a little prayer for our moment.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630712018682/)

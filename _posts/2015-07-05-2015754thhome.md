Last year was our inauguration &#8211;&nbsp;our official induction &#8211; into the neighborhood. We headed downtown for the&nbsp;DC parade,&nbsp;but the fun didn&#8217;t stop there! We&nbsp;pull&nbsp;up back at home to the entire street blocked off and a pyromaniacs dream lit up and down the row.

I was&nbsp;not ready.&nbsp;See I&nbsp;have always been in the &#8220;unlawful&#8221; part of the US. &nbsp;The part where&nbsp;if you were lucky enough to get your hands on a firework and smuggle it in, you lit it and ran!! so my knowledge and experience pretty much boil down to the year Jennifer and I started dating and in an unfortunate incident, I&nbsp;lit his Uncle&#8217;s buick on fire&#8230; I ran like hell and haven&#8217;t delved since. &nbsp;

Virginia is not that place. &nbsp;It is a completely legal, supported, CELEBRATED! form of entertainment.

This year we were ready! I had a bag of recently purchased, totally legal;0&nbsp;assortment of sparklers, snakes, and (the piece de resistance &#8211;&nbsp;A Spangled Star!) Now, did I&nbsp;know what a Spangled Star was?!? NOPE! but the guy at the fireworks&nbsp;stand (and that&#8217;s a temporarily&nbsp;trailer&nbsp;parked in a&nbsp;lot completely crammed full of&nbsp;explosive devices) told me to light the fuse and run!

RUN! got it ðŸ˜‰

So last night, we banded together, old and new to feast, laugh and light the sky.&nbsp;It was one for the record books.&nbsp;

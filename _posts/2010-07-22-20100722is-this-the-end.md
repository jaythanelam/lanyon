<a rel="attachment wp-att-830" href="/teamelam/assets/images/loving-independence/1280907550000-missing.jpg" /></a>we rang in this independence day just as i&#8217;ve hoped since Noah was born!  This 4th we celebrated in true american fashion as we grilled out with friends &#8211; thanks cara- walked to the beach &#8211; thanks crockett &#8211; and stayed up WAY TO LATE to see the fireworks.  Our kiddos were way past bedtime when the fire lit the sky but ooh the memories.  Good time good friends!

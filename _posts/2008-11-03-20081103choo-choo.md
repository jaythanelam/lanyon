We took advantage of the warm-ish weather and drove up to this little train station in the Dells so that Noah (who is in LOVE with choo choo trains) could ride in an actual locomotor. <img id="image238" alt="train.jpg" src="/teamelam/assets/images/CHOO-CHOO/1224421962000-missing.jpg" />suffice it to say, Noah was a little shell shocked by the actual choo choo of the train, it was loud with real steam and blasting whistles and it just about scared the crap out of him.

Yes! We just celebrated Noah&#8217;s VERY FIRST BIRTHDAY! Jennifer and i decided to dedicate a time capsule to him to be opened on his 21st birthday and asked many of you to help contribute to that cause! We&#8217;ve just about finished getting everything together and have been overcome by the notes, letters, pictures, and mementos that you have sent! We&#8217;ve also included some of his very first pictures (his ultrasound photos) as well as a map of his DNA, pictures from this birthday, and some small tokens and keepsakes! Thank you to our family and friends that made this so special for us!

PLEASE check out all of his [birthday](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157602349418442/ "birthday") pictures on our flikr site! (click on birthday ðŸ™‚

I bought Harley some shoes today. We&#8217;re walking through the store as I spot some ballet flats. I point them out and she stops and looks up at me with this face &#8211; not&nbsp;a baby face not even a toddler face, but a supremely confident little girls face. She walks over, picks up these hiking boots and the rest is history.&nbsp;

These moments I know &#8211;&nbsp;I KNOW are flying. These small victories where I SEE the women before me and get a&nbsp;glance at&nbsp;the people they are growing to be and I just have to hold on. Knowing that this moment, when I grasp that&nbsp;small little hand in mine and she looks at me with pure trust and adoration. These are THE&nbsp;moments.

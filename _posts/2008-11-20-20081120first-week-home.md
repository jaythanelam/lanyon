I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been a week already! Baby Ima is settling into the Elam family like a pro, already dominating everyone&#8217;s attention with drama such that this world hasn&#8217;t seen since baby jennifer reigned:) while each day i feel that we get a little closer to ironing out our new routine, our little peanut has taught us a very important lesson already, she&#8217;s absolutely nothing like her big brother! Her olive skin tone, grey eyes, hate for her car seat and lack of interest in food has been a complete conundrum from the lessons we took away on the first round of this journey.

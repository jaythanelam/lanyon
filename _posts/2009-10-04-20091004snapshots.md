[This marks my 28th birthday](http://caseybowerphotography.com/blog/). We are constantly changing, everpresent to capture the next perfect day, the next unqualified moment &#8211; that encapsulates our lives. I continue to wait for the other shoe to drop, for something to happen that will bring reality back and remind me that we are getting older and that birthdays begin to mark that passage between age and youth, but right now, we&#8217;re vital! We&#8217;re in the middle of EVERYTHING with laughter and celebration. I have such confidence, such power in the woman I&#8217;m growing into! I wouldn&#8217;t change the younger me (although I might advise NEVER say never;) but i look back at her and think&#8230; there&#8217;s still so much you have to live!

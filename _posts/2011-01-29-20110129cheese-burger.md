<img title="IMG_0560" height="320" alt="" width="240" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-986" src="/assets/images/cheese-burger/1296456677000-missing.jpg" />We have a small camera that the kids go crazy for.  They play, they take shots and pose, it&#8217;s adorable.  Lately I&#8217;ve taken advantage of their excitement and newfound pos-y-ness and i&#8217;ve been clicking shots randomly.  I taught Ima that when you say cheese, it automatically makes your mouth curve into a smile.  She remarked that she really prefers cheeseburgers so now, every-time there&#8217;s a camera close by, she bellows out &#8220;CHEESEBURGER!&#8221;

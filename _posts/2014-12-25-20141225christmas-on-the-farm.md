The true sense of Christmas &#8211; Peace, Love, and Joy &#8211; comes so effortlessly here on the farm. There is a quiet that can only be found when you are miles and miles from civilization. There is a slower, more deliberate pace here that forces you to take a breath and sigh out the stress. I am thankful that we have this refuge. Thankful that the kids have the experience of where life comes from &#8211; Farm to Table has a whole different meaning!! And so very thankful we have so many here who love us.

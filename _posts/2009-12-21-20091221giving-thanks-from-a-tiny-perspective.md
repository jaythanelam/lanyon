We totally rocked the corn pudding and sweet potato casserole but fumbled the turkey as an extra hour in the oven did nothing to thaw him!  We ended up nibbling the outside and laughing at the fact that even the 6 calls to my mom couldn&#8217;t melt his heart and fix that crazy bird!! We ended the day driving around a christmas village and checking out all the lights.  Such a great holiday and so very much to be thankful for!

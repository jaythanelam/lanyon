Well its that time again. Bare with us as I proceed to change the blog design over the next few days. I have been given a request by my love-ly wife that I combine my professional blog with our home blog in an attempt to unite these two wonderful literary experiences. So, in order to do this easily (but mostly because I want to change the design), I am reordering some things for the bette&#8230; I hope. You might experience some discomfort with this process. If you feel any burning or reddness you might want to consult a physician, however for all other symptoms just drink some wine and hang out because its going to be a bumpy ride!

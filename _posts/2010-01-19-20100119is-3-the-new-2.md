Her baby brother, Sufyan, was born 1/14 weighing in at 8lbs 20 inches and is sure to be another dazzling addition to the Ali&#8217;s!! It is an understatement to say that we enjoyed having Mina.  Jennifer and I both felt a shift as the weekend progressed where 3 little people running around, making chaos, just felt right!</a>

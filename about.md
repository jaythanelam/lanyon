I started out a scientist. I love to test, riddle, question and discover. Little did I know, I would also have a calling as an aesthetician, accountant, author, personal trainer, motivational speaker and crises negotiator!

My army of one has miraculously grown to a team of 6 and now our adventures are the experiments - one after another - sun up to sun down :)

This is our story, our home away from home, and our adventures as a team. Welcome to Team Elam :)

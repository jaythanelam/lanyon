It completely blows my mind the way things change on a weekly basis here. My son, Noah Emmett Elam, is discovering the world around him one reach at a time.

This week, he is grasping and shaking rattles, he&#8217;s working on rolling from side to side, he&#8217;s getting more excited about assisted standing, and has finally outgrown his [bassinet](http://www.stokkeusa.com/sleepi3.htm "bassinet") graduating to a big boy crib.

The realization that we needed to expand hit when i came in to find him latched onto the sides of the rails with both hands while touching opposite ends with head and feet. It was a sad day. The retiring took a small ceremony as Jennifer said a few nice words before we dismantled it. We have since [painted the nursery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "painted the nursery") and are using our custom sheets and blankets (via my mother-in-law)!

What can I say, he loves it! and so life is as it should be, as Noah is sleeping in style.

This past week has been one of wonder (as the first couple of feet of snow descended upon us) to excitement (I mean think of what we can do in all of that snow) to sheer exhaustion (when Jennifer and i had to dig out the saturn for the third time) What can i say, it&#8217;s wisconsin!!! For all of you, reading this in the south working on your tans, you suck!

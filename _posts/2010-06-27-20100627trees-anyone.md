<a rel="attachment wp-att-732" href="/teamelam/assets/images/trees-anyoneand-8230/1277731905000-missing.jpg" /></a>[when we found out we were pregnant with Noah and got over the initial shock of the miracle that is our little man, I started to check out nurseries for ideas on what to do for our baby room.  I kept coming back to trees.  I love the growth, the element of nature, the comfort and security of a fully grown canopy&#8230; anyways, Jennifer and I poured over ideas and finally found one in DIY we loved.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/425526927/sizes/l/)

[I&#8217;m so excited we&#8217;ve come into some breathing room to latch back onto this central theme and with a few minor tweaks to add some Ima element, we&#8217;ve finally started painting our new version nursery!   I can&#8217;t wait to share with you!!  Here&#8217;s Noah&#8217;s old room to hold you till we get this new one done!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/425526927/sizes/l/)

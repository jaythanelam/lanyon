When I met my girls on that fateful day so long ago, we celebrated, we bonded and we threw our kids together for a lifeline. And even though we expanded &#8211; we had more babies, met new friends &#8211; most of everything we did remained centered around our oldest bambinos. Looking back on it, I really didn&#8217;t delineate between Noah and Ima, I just started to raise them together. Whatever we did &#8211; plans, playdates, toys and trips &#8211; we did together. And that worked&#8230; Until now. Noah has started kindergarten and he is ecstatic about this newfound freedom, but Ima&#8217;s been so lost trying to find her footing in this new place all by herself.

I started scouting preschools trying to find a place that could be unique to her. It&#8217;s been tough. The transition from &#8220;Hey! what do you want to do today&#8221; to &#8220;This is where you&#8217;re going today. Have fun!&#8221; was a tricky sell, but today it paid off. Her friend Kieran &#8211; from school &#8211; celebrated his 4th birthday and Imagen Vada was there with bells on &#8211; at least the bells came out after we explored the gym together and she got comfortable enough to go in without me. There was a moment when I looked up and saw that she was so happy and comfortable with her friends &#8211; all from school &#8211; that just made my heart happy.

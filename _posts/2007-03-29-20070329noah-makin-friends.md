WHEW! It&#8217;s been a crazy couple of weeks! Noah and I went to our first fancy playgroup! It was fantastic to meet some new moms and dads and talk about the trials and treasures of staying home with our little one&#8217;s! This is noah and bodie getting acquainted on the floor.

We have our 2nd swim class tonight and due to a mishap in the bedroom last night (get your minds out of the gutters! Jennifer stubbed his toe on the bed!!)  I&#8217;ll be the only one in the pool with Noah!!  this is lucky for you folks as that opens up Jennifer to play photographer!  See you soon!

WE DID IT!

When I first met Jennifer I felt like I&#8217;d found the one person I&#8217;d go into the abyss with. Someone I could jump with, who&#8217;d be there by my side to surge forward when no one else wanted to push. Well, we just jumped!

We are now the official full-time owners and partners of JDE llc!  JDE: Jennifer Davenport-Elam/Jennifer Daniel Elam is our &#8220;parent company,&#8221; as our goal is to form a number of different underlying offshoots.  In essence JDE will act as an umbrella to the smaller division companies/partnerships.

[JOINTLEY](http://www.jointley.com/) &#8211; our creative design offshoot &#8211; is the first of these sister companies. So far, our joint design endeavor is BOOMING! We are still in our infancy stage i.e. getting to know each-others &#8220;work laugh&#8221; but so-far-so-good!
